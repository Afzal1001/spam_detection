📩 SMS Spam Detection System

This project focuses on building an NLP-based SMS spam classifier using Python. Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated to classify SMS messages as spam or ham, achieving a best accuracy of 97.5% through comparative model analysis.

The workflow includes text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming), feature extraction using techniques such as Bag of Words and TF-IDF, and model training using popular classification algorithms. Performance was evaluated using standard metrics to identify the most effective model.
